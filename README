To run the door, execute the following command

           slots.exe [DROPFILE] [SOCKET]

where [DROPFILE] is the full path and filename of the door32.sys dropfile.
Ensure that the working directory is the MagiSlots directory. Use door32.sys
on windows, and door.sys on linux.

[SOCKET] is optional, and only needed if using door.sys on Windows.
